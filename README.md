# Go Streaming Service CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates the use of GitHub Actions to automate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) workflows for a Go-based project. The workflows cover a range of use cases from testing and building Go applications to deploying them on Kubernetes and managing infrastructure with Terraform.

## Use Cases

### 1. Go Unit Testing
Automated unit tests ensure code quality and functionality with each commit, reducing bugs and improving reliability.

### 2. Go Lint Testing
Enforces coding standards and identifies potential errors through static analysis, maintaining codebase consistency and quality.

### 3. Improve Go Builds
Automates the compilation process across multiple platforms, ensuring the Go application is built correctly for each target environment.

### 4. Interact with Go APIs from Source Code
Facilitates automated interactions with Go APIs for tasks such as data migrations and automated testing, improving efficiency and reducing manual errors.

### 5. Writing GitHub Actions in Go
Utilizes the power of Go to write custom GitHub Actions, allowing for more complex automation tasks and efficient processing.

### 6. CI/CD for Open Source Go Projects
Provides a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for open source Go projects, automating testing, building, and releasing processes.

### 7. Go Application Deployment to Kubernetes
Streamlines the deployment of Go applications to Kubernetes, managing containerization, image registry, and deployment strategies.

### 8. Go Backend with React Frontend
Integrates CI/CD workflows for projects with a Go backend and React frontend, ensuring seamless deployment of full-stack applications.

### 9. Go Front End Web Server
Automates the deployment of Go-based web servers, which can serve static assets or act as reverse proxies for the streaming service.

### 10. Custom Terraform Provider written in Go
Automates the release process for custom Terraform providers written in Go, facilitating infrastructure management as code.

## How It Works

Each GitHub Action workflow in this project is triggered by specific GitHub events, such as `push` or `pull_request`, to perform tasks related to building, testing, linting, deploying, and managing infrastructure.

- **Unit and Lint Testing**: On every push or pull request, the Go code is automatically tested and lint-checked to ensure quality and standards compliance.
- **Build and Deployment**: Commits to the main branch trigger the build process, creating Docker images for Go applications and deploying them to Kubernetes or updating infrastructure with Terraform.
- **Custom Workflows**: For complex tasks, custom Go scripts are used within GitHub Actions to interact with APIs, manage deployments, or perform infrastructure changes.

## Getting Started

To utilize these workflows in your project:

1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Modify the GitHub Action workflow files under `.github/workflows/` as per your project's requirements.
3. Set up the necessary secrets in your GitHub repository settings for actions that require authentication (e.g., Docker Hub credentials, Kubernetes config).
4. Push changes to your repository to trigger the workflows.
